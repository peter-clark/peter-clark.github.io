<div style="text-align: justify">My name is Peter Clark, I am an AI researcher currently specializing in the interplay between cognition and the perception and reproduction of sound and music. I am incredibly interested in philosophy of mind, abiogenesis and the origin of complex behaviors from simple systems, and the absurdity of the universe.  While I currently reside in Barcelona, I am originally from Alaska and have lived internationally for most of my life in countries including Bhutan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Republic of Georgia, Moldova, Netherlands, and Uruguay. <br> <br> This website serves as a home for sharing my works, my thoughts, and my interests.  </div>
